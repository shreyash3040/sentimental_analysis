100,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.I’ll update this review after one month of usage."
101,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
102,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
103,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The media could not be loaded.                  Don't buy this lap  ... Don't be fool .I spent around 70,000 for the lap, when I open laptop it's screen off and on happening automatically.You can see the video above attached.I request to replacement for the laptop, but not yet got any update.. already completed 15 days."
104,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
105,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,It's too strange to see a brand new HP  pavilion laptop got hung in the very second use. None of the keys working....can't even shut down......totally helpless....disappointment at its peak .....The packaging too was no way near the required....Frustration....disappointment....too bad experience.....
106,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.Some closing thoughts:The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!"
107,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"As soon as the warranty period got over, laptop got defected .I complaind to hp care then it came to notice that amazone has not mentioned s.no in the bill for rectification of this error amazone took approx 18 days to correct the bill and for replacement of defective item Amazon is still making fool that your case is under escalation team and continuously giving new target date but not  giving resolution. I am totally feeling mentally harrashed"
108,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,Laptop is good and Fast but the GHZ mentioned is not correct they say 4.2 ghz but what we receive is only 2.4 Ghz. I cannot put my earphone in this laptop since it is liitle bit small. earphone from jbl and working fine in mobile. overall laptop is good in this price range
109,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,Nice product. USB type C can be used for charging but didn't work with 30W Oneplus 7T charger. May be work with 65 watt smartphone charger. Backlight Keyboard has only 2 dimming light settings. Apart from these everything is excellent.
110,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
111,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
112,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
113,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
114,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.Again this kind of behaviour from one of the reputed sellers on the platform is disappointing."
115,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,The media could not be loaded.                  Please exchange the product immediately. The monitor screen is not switching on. This is the 2nd time I switched it on and its not working. I just purchased it on 2nd September 2021.

117,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.Advantage1. Light Weight2. Slim Body3. Great Display & Camera4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound5. Output heat is place between screenDisadvantage1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply4. There are 2 USB  & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB AConclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
118,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,THE PROCESSOR MENTIONED ON WEBSITE IS OF 4.2GHZ BUT WHAT I RECIEVED IS OF 2.4GHZ
119,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,Pavillions are the worst laptops please think twice before buying this product I have Pavillion laptop i5 but the performance is really not to the point plus i have graphics card and its not up to point as it seems to be better buy a asus laptop
120,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
121,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"First, Notebook is Over HeatingSecond,  Notebook is not openingI am fully unsatisfied"
122,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The media could not be loaded.                  I got the DV1001TU  model. Product description claims to be anti-glare screen but in fact, it is so highly reflective like a mirror, that I can comb my hairs using it; very uncomfortable to work on. Touchscreen laptops usually have reflective screens (like the one on the right in the video that I've uploaded), but this is not even touchscreen. Simply unacceptable screen quality. The product is not returnable; it's replacement only and Amazon makes it a walk through hell, to return this on account of false description.Connecting second monitor over USB-C DP does not work; second display as well as the laptop display starts losing signal. Driver update makes not difference.Windows 11 is preinstalled and its not easy to install Windows 10; drivers for SSD are missing if you try a clean install with ISO created with Windows Media Creation Tool."
123,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The media could not be loaded.                  1. I bought this laptop in exchange. Old laptop had a Lil crash on it. Delivery guy first denied to exchange as there was a small crack. When I said to back the new product he asked me some money and said he ll manage at his end. I didn't pay him. Later on he agreed to take old product and in case if it gets rejected in the policy he ll take back new laptop. But nothing went wrong so he didn't call me back after.2. Please see the images and video. In just 6 months of use I faced display flickering issue. Even though it was under warranty, I had to run to service center for repair. They tried to reinstall OS but it was of no use. Finally they had to change the entire display and to my surprise even that didn't solve the issue.I am still facing the same flickering of display issue.Frustrated with the service and quality of the product."
124,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"Everything is good. But I am little bit disappointed , I was expecting better battery backup."
125,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,The media could not be loaded.                  Writing review after a week of using my beautiful slim light weight laptop.No need to describe much as I found no cons in this laptop functioning nice no issues till now price might be a bit high but overall I found very nice and handy laptop for all students and study purpose and using software applications running smooth.
126,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I’m still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP. Would have given negative 10 stars for Earth’s customer centric company if possible."
127,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
128,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,2,It’s look like renewed laptop because laptop charging jack is loose and left side speaker sounds like it’s tear. Bad sound quality  and finger sensor quality look like 2011 touch phone of wing and any Chinese phone touch. Waste of money and one more thing day by day Amazon product quality getting poor
129,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue."
130,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"I had given a good review earlier but 40 days later it is different story altogether. HP black screen problem is all pervading. I have installed no softwares nothing that could harm computer, but it is giving me ride for the day. No amount of customer response is helping.  I have scheduled for on site visit. Let's see where it goes.Switch to apple if you can afford."
131,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,This is my first laptop and i love it !... It turn on within in fraction of seconds..Pros :1) 16 gigs of RAM & i 5 11 gen processor gives the butter smooth experience.2) Excellent battery lifeCons:Touch pad should be more precise
132,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,2,"Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.Bad experience after paying high price (around ₹67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive). Preloaded with Win10 Home and MS Office (not sure whether trial or full version). Drawbacks - weighs 1.42 kg, base gets warm rather quickly and so does the power adapter. Decent for a college student."

Start-up is extremely smooth and fast with Windows Hello Fingerprint Scan and no problems encountered in the last more than 15 days of daily usage. The fingerprint scanner can however only be used for Windows Hello, it cannot be used for entering your password on websites using HP Security Manager App (as confirmed by HP Support Specialist). Other than this, no problems with the hardware configuration."

Your charger pin short circuited without any liquid spill or moisture.I have a 8 year old Dell laptop, and a 6 year old Acer . Both had no issues in the same house hold.I will never trust this company again.Cheap company , cheap product and utterly disappointing service.It will work like charm UNTIL it can, and then the HP will start drilling more holes in your pocket ."
147,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"HP would not consider dead pixel in warranty as they need 2 dead pixels. Above that if in case there is a dead pixel, then they will try their best to put up many reasons to not entertain it in warranty, calling it customer induced damage.. LOL..Buy this at your own risk from Amazon. Who knows what i faced was because of Amazon induced damage during delivery...Someone tell HP that most common reason for a dead pixel is a MANUFACTURING DEFECT.."

154,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,Quality of the laptop seems to be more premium and the lightweight of the laptop fits to our hand. I am not a gamer for normal usage it seems best in class. HP had worked very well in this series with good quality speakers and keyboards are nice power. On and off in lightening speed with the ssd  but the only disadvantage is the internal webcam which makes me very disappointed . its just a hd camera. For this price range HP should work on the camera section. overall nice product.

There is not enough time to diagnose and react for a return or a replacement and amazon hides behind this fine print not to rpovide any customer support. HP doesnt help with the defect because it was bought from amazon. The worst effect is on us who paid BIG bucks for the below average product from HP and poor customer service from amazon.
160,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,Had an issue with the product and the HP service support is horrible.I have called their support number about 10 times and written multiple emails.

The HP Pavilion comes as a surprise  .PositivesLight to carry , great screen display , perfect picture and a good bundlingNegativesOnly two UAB ports so you need a USB Bus , keyboard with backlit is at times blinding , keys are a bit flimsy and there is no accessory like a carry bag, mouse, mouse pad etc . Looks delicate overall as compared to much earlier versionsOverall a decent buy if you use an external keyboard and have a USB Hub ."
166,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"I have been using this laptop since August, it's very compact and lightweight. The weight distribution is good but you still cannot open the lid with one hand.The screen is okay not the best I have seen but you can perform day to day task very easily.Keyboard is quite good, the key travel is nice and the three-level backlight is awesome.The battery is same as any slim professional laptop, gives 4-5 hrs battery backup in normal use and definitely this number reduces when heavy tasks are performed.Fingerprint accuracy 8.5/10.Upgradability is the single ssd that you can swap for more storage and from two- 8gb ram one them is upgradable.Conclusion, this laptop is a very good performer in the basic to semi-heavy tasks. Due to lack of dedicated graphics card, games are not as smooth they should be but as a professional this device in one of the best."

169,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"Cons:This laptop has rectangular display and if you were using MacBook 13, you might get surprised to see this screen feels smaller than that. So I suggest checking this out in physical store before buying.I did not like the mouse trackpad as it’s not very responsive and sometimes gives wrong feedback.Battery is decent, If not the best.Pros:Thin, sleek, lightweight and handy.Windows package is good with free office.Laptop in general is quite fast"

175,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"Battery is degraded to 78% of full design capacity after only a year. Talked to customer service, they have no idea how battery works and says full design capacity fluctuates charge by charge (WTF). Denied any repair or replacement. Service technicians have no idea what they are doing. Laptop heats up a lot (incredibly uncomfortable to hold), I think CPU power management tuning is not done properly, did it myself by reading windows documentation, dose not heat up that much now. Overall good machine but that battery issue is just not acceptable. Service is non existent, they will frustrate you till you give up. For you own peace of mind do not buy this laptop."
