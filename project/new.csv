0,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing."
1,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Bad experience! I have purchased Iphone from Amazon before as well but this time the activation of new iphone 12 failed when I was setting it up. I tried contacting Apple support but the serial number mentioned on the box was invalid. I really don't know if it is a counterfeit product or there is some technical issue but one thing is sure that Apple's Website is not recognising the IMEI and serial Number of new Iphone 12 I bought from here
2,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this."
3,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,Same like the old classic iphone 5 lookBut now difference is only6.1 inch display or The A 14 bionic chipAnd oled Hd display
4,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"Device is wonderful but never buy expensive items from Amazon, its better to purchase from Apple store.Delayed delivery by 3 days and on top of it no one in amazon knows where my device was. I have to perform multiple follow ups to enquire about my device and Amazon CSR is worst when it comes to logging a complaint.The final product received is having a dent and Amazon denied servicing and asked to check with Apple, Apple of-course denied since the product is purchased from third party e-commerce website.Lesson learned after 5 days of total frustration and being played as shuttlecock between Amazon and Apple, its better to spend few bucks more and purchase iPhone from Apple rather than typing this review with a dented device."
5,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†I was litterly worried before getting it delivered, as my delivery was late, I thought they will be some golmal on product, but I got the original product which I was expecting.. pls go n buy, don't get panic by seeing reviews.. I'm very excited with my new phone.. battery life is also good. Face is awesomepart and camera quality at picks... best deal for this independence day üòçü§©"
6,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Its my First Apple device. Happy to own it after a long confusion between iPhone 11 and 12. I believe, it was worth waiting for 12.Received it on 04-Nov-2020. Working well till now. Checked Service Support Coverage. Its a genuine product.AndiPhone in white color is legend.Update after 1 month approx.-----------------------------------After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don't shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.Worth every penny."
7,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"Bought an iPhone 12 during ongoing freedom sale and I received a defective piece as the phone has tiny dents around the charging port. I tried returning it but there‚Äôs no option to replace or return.  Don‚Äôt know what to do, stuck with it after spending 62 K."
8,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Amazing iPhone, worthy updatehave to buy a type-c supported charging adaptor for charginggood displaydecent battery lifenice night clicksoverall worthy upgrade from classic iPhonebuy apple original 20w adaptor for charging, it fill battery faster than any other adaptor"
9,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn‚Äôt seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model."
10,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,Great battery life. Love the white colour. Blue is super hyped. It is a finger print magnet.There‚Äôs something about the design of these phones. No android phone can match the aesthetics. Except some curved display screens.Upgraded from iPhone 8. I am very very happy.Wish it was a bit cheaper. Bought with 6k instant hdfc discount and 6 months no cost emi.128gb.
11,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†This is first time I‚Äôm switching from android to iOSIt is just amazingBatter life is awesome
12,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,Overall mobile is good but found blue spots on side and upper frame. This is not expected from Amazon. This is my worst order experience with Amazon. Really disappointing!
13,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†I got this iphone 12 defected peace from amazone , so i contact to amazone support but they refuse to replace the item and suggested me to go in apple service centre to repair this issue .So finally i went to the service centre and they helped me and take my phone for 7-8 days for screen replacement, but at the end i got my phone with replaced screen and now its working fine.Note - the product service centre service is good , but sorry i can‚Äôt say the same for amazon support ."
14,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Was out of country and have opened this iPhone which I have ordered in Jan yesterday only and have found that it was damaged from screen .How can I get a product replacement as return window has also got closed and have got a defected product .Pls help
15,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Its outstanding. I was using iphone 12 mini. Size wise this is better. This is amazing machine. Camera is great, performance is amazing, display is outstanding. Using iPhone 12 is some thing I never experienced before. This is fantastic device.RatingsSpeed - 5/5Display - 5/5Battery - 5/5Weight - 5/5Camera - 4.5/5You need a proper light for great photo. In low light sometime photo is quite dark but original.If you are new to apple eco system then you are going to experience something great. If you have already used apple devices then it will not disappoint you."
16,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Now it's almost more than 2 weeks of usage and I'm fully satisfied with the performance. Earlier I was using oneplus 6T and after malfunction of the screen, i decided to move to Iphone. Before buying i had done all the R&D. Many of reviews says that it has bad battery life and couldn't stand a day. But as per my usages my battery stays all day long. I used to make call (6 to 7 hours), video, music, surfing everything except game and battery last upto 24 hours with data mode on.In my opinion its worth buying."
17,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,Battery performance is disgusting. Camera is 4/5. Gaming amazing. Heat up so much. Everytime heating problem comes out. While charging or gaming....heat up so much.
18,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"This is my first iPhone purchase , coming from oneplus 7 I don't have any regrets about the switch. Yes the switch was painful (especially because I lost all my whatsapp chats) but is worth it. comparing to oneplus 7, this phone has all features from it but in better form. My OP7 was smooth, fast had good battery camera,battery and  haptics. iPhone is just way smoother,fast and have great camera,battery and haptics. There is a slight learning curve. took 2 days to get used to gestures and navigations but is smooth sailing. the only negative feedback would be no charger in the box. You will have to get from apple.com if you want fast 20W one."
19,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Upgraded from an iPhone 7 32 gigs to iPhone 12 . After holding out for a long time the upgrade was worth it. All the feature set display, camera, speakers, signal reception, chipset is a huge upgrade. Recommended if you happen to have a device from 2016 or older. This device will be the new standard iPhone for the next 4 years. So worth it if you get it now."
20,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only.I got a defective product and when I complain about it to amazon customer care and requested for replacement they simply deny to replace it.Don't waste your money.
21,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Since launch I am using iphone, previously I buy from show room, but now I living at a place there is no iPhone showroom available, so now  I buy it online from amazon, always there is risk of buying such costly thing online, but always amazon delivered original apple product to me,Now it‚Äôs near about 1 yrs from purchase of iPhone 12, there is no issue till date"
22,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,Worst for money
23,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,It‚Äôs a nice one under 50k (after discounts and exchange) as usual superb camera quality as its IOS and so do build quality. You need to activate esim from adhar based state and then can use it as secondary sim.
24,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"The Best iphone i have used ,Camera is a beast, speakers are superb, display is unbelievable, and battery has never been better!But the touch response has been poor i am unable to type like i used to do on my iphone 7 or 8."
25,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,2,Minor dents on corners and scratches on main screen spending 80k to get this sucks. Dont recommend to buy especially from this seller.
26,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"The product was getting overheated too soon while using apple apps like iMovie.Also got heated while chargingIf I have to buy an 80k phone and just make calls and messages... doesn't make sense..And Amazon would not replace it just like that they need a letter from Apple stating ""Service Denial"" so shuttling between Amazon and Apple after 2 days of purchase."
27,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,if u r selfi lover  i dont reccomend this
28,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Delivery boy ki aankhon mein viswas dikh jaata hai ki product real hai lelo bina khole ,so no open box delivery need‚Ä¶..phone is brilliant everything is fine‚Ä¶. Camera is blast‚Ä¶.. shifting from iPhone first time but not facing any issue."
29,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000‚Çπ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000‚Çπ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000‚Çπ. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900‚Çπ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure."
30,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,2,"For some reason the phone is going blank suddenly, while using WhatsApp and other apps"
31,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,It‚Äôs used phone delivered to me
32,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"In description it has iPhone 12 with 6.1 inch display, but actually received is iPhone 12 mini, it's total fraud with customers"
33,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"While the iPhone 11 is an amazing device, without doubt, yet it has an IPS display. Older iPhone X and iPhone XS had OLED displays. Apple returned to OLED again with iPhone 12, although the refresh rate is at 60Hz. For those, who have not used devices with 90Hz or 120Hz, you would not notice any differences. Moving from an older iPhone with IPS display to iPhone 12, and you would immediately notice the crisp blacks. Battery size physically is less than the iPhone 11, yet Apple tweaks the A14 Bionic coupled with the iOS, which easily stretches the charge for 10-12hrs. on regular usage. Those heavily into web browsing, gaming etc. may not have such a long run with a single charge, yet it is capable enough for a pretty long day, without the need to plug in to the outlet. Oh, and yes, iPhone 12 comes with a USB-C to Lightning cable, but no charger. You will need to get a USB-C charger separately, either from Apple or other brands. Else, you can use your Qi charger, if you have one already.iPhone 12 also has a more boxy look, a throwback to the iconic iPhone 4 days. Overall, as with any Apple phone, it is an amazing device, if you use your smartphone for all the regular usage like apps, gaming, web browsing. And yes, it can send messages. Oh, forgot, it can make and receive calls too, quite well!"
34,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"Pros- decent camera, display is amazing, phone is compact and handy.Cons- battery is not upto the mark, phone heats up when multitasking"

99,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,Heating issue. Lot is heat is getting discharged
100,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It‚Äôs a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There‚Äôs no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it‚Äôs body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It‚Äôs light weight as it‚Äôs a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it‚Äôs expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it‚Äôs a really well thought product by HP.I‚Äôll update this review after one month of usage."
101,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
102,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
103,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Don't buy this lap  ... Don't be fool .I spent around 70,000 for the lap, when I open laptop it's screen off and on happening automatically.You can see the video above attached.I request to replacement for the laptop, but not yet got any update.. already completed 15 days."
104,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
105,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,It's too strange to see a brand new HP  pavilion laptop got hung in the very second use. None of the keys working....can't even shut down......totally helpless....disappointment at its peak .....The packaging too was no way near the required....Frustration....disappointment....too bad experience.....
106,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It‚Äôs the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It‚Äôs a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.Some closing thoughts:The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!"
107,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"As soon as the warranty period got over, laptop got defected .I complaind to hp care then it came to notice that amazone has not mentioned s.no in the bill for rectification of this error amazone took approx 18 days to correct the bill and for replacement of defective item Amazon is still making fool that your case is under escalation team and continuously giving new target date but not  giving resolution. I am totally feeling mentally harrashed"
108,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,Laptop is good and Fast but the GHZ mentioned is not correct they say 4.2 ghz but what we receive is only 2.4 Ghz. I cannot put my earphone in this laptop since it is liitle bit small. earphone from jbl and working fine in mobile. overall laptop is good in this price range
109,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,Nice product. USB type C can be used for charging but didn't work with 30W Oneplus 7T charger. May be work with 65 watt smartphone charger. Backlight Keyboard has only 2 dimming light settings. Apart from these everything is excellent.
110,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
111,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
112,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
113,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
114,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.Again this kind of behaviour from one of the reputed sellers on the platform is disappointing."
115,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Please exchange the product immediately. The monitor screen is not switching on. This is the 2nd time I switched it on and its not working. I just purchased it on 2nd September 2021.

117,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.Advantage1. Light Weight2. Slim Body3. Great Display & Camera4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound5. Output heat is place between screenDisadvantage1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply4. There are 2 USB  & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB AConclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
118,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,THE PROCESSOR MENTIONED ON WEBSITE IS OF 4.2GHZ BUT WHAT I RECIEVED IS OF 2.4GHZ
119,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,Pavillions are the worst laptops please think twice before buying this product I have Pavillion laptop i5 but the performance is really not to the point plus i have graphics card and its not up to point as it seems to be better buy a asus laptop
120,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy.

122,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†I got the DV1001TU  model. Product description claims to be anti-glare screen but in fact, it is so highly reflective like a mirror, that I can comb my hairs using it; very uncomfortable to work on. Touchscreen laptops usually have reflective screens (like the one on the right in the video that I've uploaded), but this is not even touchscreen. Simply unacceptable screen quality. The product is not returnable; it's replacement only and Amazon makes it a walk through hell, to return this on account of false description.Connecting second monitor over USB-C DP does not work; second display as well as the laptop display starts losing signal. Driver update makes not difference.Windows 11 is preinstalled and its not easy to install Windows 10; drivers for SSD are missing if you try a clean install with ISO created with Windows Media Creation Tool."
123,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†1. I bought this laptop in exchange. Old laptop had a Lil crash on it. Delivery guy first denied to exchange as there was a small crack. When I said to back the new product he asked me some money and said he ll manage at his end. I didn't pay him. Later on he agreed to take old product and in case if it gets rejected in the policy he ll take back new laptop. But nothing went wrong so he didn't call me back after.2. Please see the images and video. In just 6 months of use I faced display flickering issue. Even though it was under warranty, I had to run to service center for repair. They tried to reinstall OS but it was of no use. Finally they had to change the entire display and to my surprise even that didn't solve the issue.I am still facing the same flickering of display issue.Frustrated with the service and quality of the product."

125,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,4,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Writing review after a week of using my beautiful slim light weight laptop.No need to describe much as I found no cons in this laptop functioning nice no issues till now price might be a bit high but overall I found very nice and handy laptop for all students and study purpose and using software applications running smooth.
126,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,1,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I‚Äôm still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP. Would have given negative 10 stars for Earth‚Äôs customer centric company if possible."
127,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
128,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,2,It‚Äôs look like renewed laptop because laptop charging jack is loose and left side speaker sounds like it‚Äôs tear. Bad sound quality  and finger sensor quality look like 2011 touch phone of wing and any Chinese phone touch. Waste of money and one more thing day by day Amazon product quality getting poor
129,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue."
130,HP Pavilion 14 11th Gen Intel Core i5 16GB RAM,5,"I had given a good review earlier but 40 days later it is different story altogether. HP black screen problem is all pervading.

Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.Bad experience after paying high price (around ‚Çπ67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive). Preloaded with Win10 Home and MS Office (not sure whether trial or full version). Drawbacks - weighs 1.42 kg, base gets warm rather quickly and so does the power adapter.

200,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"My review is a little bit long(sorry!) but I have shared my genuine experience after 7 days of use, it will help you decide whether you want to have these or not:Review [Day 3] (read review on last day of return below this):I loved these airdopes, tested it's batteries after 5 days of use, there doesn't seem to be any problem till now (as most of the reviews had problem related to charging and battery backup.)I am a casual user, music listener and video watcher, so for me it is simply the best.I previously encountered electrical interference in latest launched earbuds which is not at all present in these.Also, the feel of having these in ears is really soft, I used them throughout the day and they were great.Now, bass is quite down in these, also with 8 mm driver it is not that good with low frequency sounds. But it's just a minor loss nothing serious.At 999/- It can assure you BoAt service for a year and also great Battery backup.Earbuds : 5:30 hrCase : 5 times chargedNot 42 hours but around 30-32 hours overall.Not fit to enjoy gaming for hardcore gamers but great for casual gaming.ENC is present but I would say it is very light or rather negligible.Range is 5-7 m (with walls in between.)I charged it @ 10% battery first time, but will try to charge @ 30% or above from now to increase charging cycles. I was confused when to charge them, but apparently it's better to charge them as soon as you don't need them to have a good battery life, also avoid going below 10%.Right now with so many variants out there I believe if you do have a need of earbuds for normal use, these are the best.And one more thing don't forget to check whether the airdopes come to you with plastic sealed box or not. If they are not sealed in plastic then there is high chance of these being a returned product, which may or may not be as good as the one right out of the factory product.[Day 7 with some problems resolved]#Prob 1:The sound abruptly reduced, what I was getting earlier at 40% volume level now became 100% volume level.Prob #2:Also, the pair is not connecting as it should i.e. on opening the caseNow I am deciding to return the product as it is the last day, but suddenly I remembered: The Troubleshooting manual, and tried the following:Solution#:Unpair from the Bluetooth and pair again (even reset it if you want but first unpair it.)Do this üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ and most probably the disconnecting one side bud or bad volume level will be reset and hopefully will become the same as when we received.Note: But there is this issue of it getting functioning faulty and that when I thoroughly took care of it, never dropped it, softly handled it, charged above 40% etc. So technically these airdopes are not perfected for long use, you may notice some misbehaviour from time to time, but most probably the problem can be reset. So do decide whether to purchase these or not knowing this!I hope it helps you, as I was finding this kind of review before purchase but there were none!This is purely based on my review after I was irritated with some ENC variants of Rs 1500-2000 range. Due to their ENC feature, I noticed electrical interference/buzzing noise.I am keeping it finally as it has at least no buzzing or irritating noise, comes from a known brand at a low budget.Update (After 3 months): This pair is still working fine. I have noticed the battery is not that better as it was initially but it is enough for 3-5 time charge (not from 0% but randomly after each use, generally from 30-50%). They will easily last you at least a day with the charging case in one charge. (Remember one day is the least, if you don't use it like crazy they can even last 2 days). I have noticed though for me using them for long does generate pain in ears (by long I mean for about 4-5 hours straight, I use them while studying to cutoff outside noises, which they perfectly do for me.) Hope it helps to share it's update over a period of use. I always look for such reviews but nobody writes so I thought let it be me onlyüòá!"
201,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"Bought it in January,posting it in August. So i've used it almost 6 months and giving honest review.In short if you are getting it during sale time @899-999,then it's a steal deal..also in regular price b/w 1299-1499 it's a good product..Sound quality is good. Enough loud at 50-60% volume. Bass is also ok. Whenever needed it produces punchy bass. Overall balanced.Mic quality is good in indoor condition,but in noisy environment you can't rely on this. Recevier can't clearly listen to you.You can do gaming as company claiming low latency,i myself didn't test it.Now about battery backup,company claim it will give battery backup of 42 hours with case. 6 hours in single charge+Additional 36 hours(6 times charge via case). But in practical use it gives total 35 hours playback. It will give around 5 hours backup on single charge of buds @ 50-60% volume(if you only listen to music or watching video,but no call or gaming) You can charge the earbuds full 6 times via case: so additional 30 hours.Just one issue with it's design,suit case type box & not easy to carry in pocket. I would say it's a personal preference. If you are into good looks,design then it's not for you.Now it's regular pricing varries between Rs 1299-1499. In this price range also it is one of the best tws under 1500. I will tell why.. now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under 1500. Most of them sound almost similar, difference is like 19/20!! They are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup & by youtubers,reviewers. 48/50 hours of playtime is just myth. I've personally used Truke(Airbuds lite,Buds F1) which is by far the most false promising brand claiming 48 hours of battery in their every tws,but only give 21 hours. Even other tws of boat(Airdopes 121 pro) which claim 40-45 hours playback only give around 25 hours,Defy Gravity Z claiming 50 hours only give 28 hours. If you are impressed by their looks & huge battery backup and thinking to buy those,you will be disappointed after purchase. Instead go with this,you will not be disappointed."
202,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like PUBG and also it falls from ear while running. And that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differenceBut a PUBG youtuber Recommended me this so I decided to give it a try, after trying out myself.Let me provide the facts for youI have a boat rockerz 510 headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing 2x better in providing accurate sound in PUBG.It‚Äôs been 2-3 days I used it daily for 6-7 hours on full charge, it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in PUBG it doesn‚Äôt give delay as written in the comments, it has a good latency better than what I had expected from the negative comments.Sometimes though I faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because it‚Äôs either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faq/guide/help card in the box I‚Äôm satisfied in terms of gaming.For sports like running I wouldn‚Äôt recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that it‚Äôs safe from landing on the ground I‚Äôm gonna try that, please don‚Äôt use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environment."
203,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"Bang for the buck.A solid case and the buds are designed in a way that you don't feel pain in your ears.Pros :Battery. Massive battery, they charge in no time and stays for a quite a while.Bass : Excellent bass.Volume is extraordinary, top notch.Cons :Connectivity distance issues, if your phone is in a different room, you won't be able to connect the buds and you'll have to move closer to your phone.0 noise cancellation, if you're looking forward to buy Earbuds with an active noise cancellation, then this isn't for you.The left earbud gets disconnected every now and then, you'll have to manually put it in the case and open it again and it gets connected on its own.Conclusion : If your preference is to watch movies and listen to music on daily basis, then you should go for it. If you're actively travelling and looking for noise cancellation buds you could use while travelling then this product isn't for you."
204,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.edit:I still stand by everything i said but after a month of using these I'm facing a lot of annoying issues.1. They pause music at the slightest of touch when you try to adjust them, but then other times they will ignore the hardest of touch when you are ACTUALLY trying to pause your music. And double tap for next song gesture doesn't work anymore idk why.2. Biggest issue, left ear bud stops charging constantly. My earbuds case is totally clean, but it keeps showing me ""10% battery remaining"" warning on my phone even if i leave this to charge for hours. Right one is just fine but left one just stops charging very often now and it doesn't get fixed for days, i have to hold the earbud down into the case for a long while and even then it can only MAYBE work.3. All the factory reset and all stuff to sort these issues don't work when one of the earbuds is totally dead and unable to charge.4. They are too soft and can easily fall out of ears if you make facial expressions for a minute or two. Only good for gym, bad for content viewing because you might laugh or smile.That's about it but this left earbud not working issue that i keep having is just really annoying. I don't know if this is just my issue with my specific unit though."
205,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"So firstly i bought this for ‚Çπ1200 itself, I guess it was a lil new back then,So starting with Sound quality i would rate them as:-Loudness:- 7/10 (I find myself thinking that if they would have been a lil louder they would be the best under 1500 Category)Music Quality:- 8.5/10 (One of the best out there)Bass:- 8.5/10 (Could be better as it is boAt)Call Quality:- 7.5/10 (People can hear me clear, Basically mic is good but the loudness when other person is talking could be better)At the end I would highlight one con & one pro of this Airdopes 141PRO:- BEST BUILD QUALITY (Because of the plastic build of the airdopes, the build quality will impress on a number of times, The airdopes box had fallen from above 5ft and still it survived with minor scratches, both the airdopes fell out of the charging case but didn't break or stopped working, So yes build wise you can go with it)CON:- THE CHARGING CASE LOOKS CHEAP (As i had pointed out above that the charging case is a pro too and con too, basically the charging case is made out soft plastic which does easily get scratched out and if it would have been a rubberised material it would have felt better and also one thing to point out at last, i would have liked if it would have had Charging indicator in Digits and not in those LED lights)Overall, it's a good Choice, You can go for it!"
206,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"Sound quality: the sound is really good, i am not an expert but as an average consumer i like the sound quality.Build quality and design: the design is good, it doesn't feels cheap, the hinge is also very satisfying to fidget, The Matt finish is good. The way the buds slide into charging position is a little bit less smooth sometimes but overall in this price point it's good.Noise cancellation: don't expect any noise cancellation, i have used this and i can say that it doesn't have any noise cancellation what so ever, even if it says in the box that it does. If you wish to record audio or call from these then find a quite place because it picks every sound around you.Battery backup: battery is also good, i get around 35-37 hours with the case, so battery is not an issue.Pairing and touch control: blootooth pairing is very fast if your device bt is already on, overall it's fast and good but it struggles if more than one paired device is near. The touch controls are a bit too sensitive as mistouch is very common.Fit: they fit me very well, they come with extra buds so you can fit your size.Tip: read the instructions about touch controls."
207,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I am writing a true review after around a week long use of these boat airdopes 141 ....CONS1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag,  voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .PROS-1. the sound quality and the bass are great .2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions ."
208,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"My review is splited into 6 subpoints:1) The audio gets distorted sometimes if you are listening to many media's at the same time.2) Audio range is about 5-6 meters if there is not obstruction in between.3) Battery backup along with charging case is around 26-30 hrs depending upon your usage, only if you use one earpod at a time instead of two. With two it's is around 20hrs.4) Noice Cancellation hardly exists, surrounding sounds can still be heard.5) The mic is very decent. The EnC is pretty good. However I would have liked to have a dedicated command or button to turn that on and off so that i could be able to record small sounds when needed, which is imposed at the moment.6) Build Quality is average, but considering other features that they give at this price point, it can be considered a good product to be considered."
209,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,6months later 3 out of 4 sets stopped working.. kind of a sad thing  . Gave it to family .. 6 months time .. 1side will stop...anyone same issueOrdered one for me on Amazon. Likes it so much that I bought 3 more for all. .Pros1)Non stop 40 hours with the box.2)Comfort is so nice you won't know if you are wearing it or not .3) it fell a couple of times but still it worked .Cons1) 2 out of 4 have completed stopped working both were under heavy usage for 6 months. Both stopped around the 6 month time. Other 2 sets are I my used for office work  and They are still fine .so it means running it for 6 months non stop will damage it.2) repair is not possible I checked.. if Sumone can repair please reply.3) you will keep losing it coz it's so comfy n you won't know when it's not on your ears .4 sets ... I m still giving 5 after 2 sets stopped workimg . Coz for 999 it gave an amazing time of non stop music .
210,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Sounds:- amazing kind of sound which is truly noise isolating, Bass is literally bombastic but in terms of vocal it performs poorBattery:- I can assure you you'll never be disappointed with its battery performance you can use it as much you want in-ear running performance is more than 3-4 hours in case it lasts more than 3 daysTouch:- it is the main problem that you're gonna face with these earphones since they can be operated with a single touch so most of the time it stops without your will. Which is really problematic for those who listen to music while laying in bed.Connectivity:- well it has many disconnection issues sometimes the left runs while the right stops sometimes the right one works while the left one stops!! It's the problem you're definitely going to facePrice:- when it comes to price air dopes are the Ace of this segment for what it offersBut still that single touch use system is problematic!!All you can do is just go for it!! For daily use and those of you who listens to music while laying in bed may avoid it for single touch system"
211,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,5,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Let me come straight to the point. There is not much to criticize about these TWS but take a look at the points. ( This is a review after 1 month of use)Pros- 1. Excellent battery life.  2. Very fast connectivity ( just open  the case and it will get connected  to the recent paired device).  3. Mic quality ok-ok type( like u can  use it for calling at normal  surrounding but not recommended  for noisy surrounding) .  4. Build quality is also ok-ok type.Cons-1. Not recommended for gaming.  2. Hinge quality not good( sometimes  it feels like it will come out in my  hands during opening).  3. If your fingers are thick you will be  facing problem while putting it in  ear( whenever I try to place the  earbud in my ear, my fingers  somehow gets touched to the  finger sensor area of earbud and if  it is in connected mode, it  automatically starts the media  which is very annoying but soon i  got used to it).Some other points which I would like to cover about these TWS.1. For media use, it is good.2. If you are bass lover then this may  disappoint you because bass is not that  good, but it has a very clear and crisp  sound and every small detail you can  hear.3. Packing is also good.*Video I uploaded in this review is a bit noisy, sorry for that*If you have read the review till now, then thank you for reading my review and again I would recommend you to check out realme buds as they are far better than these at little bit more price."
212,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†The build quality and sound quality is descent and loud enough . But I have problem in battery backup. The earbuds are not surviving for 3 hours on continuous use on zoom lecture  on full volume. And decrease in the battery backup is not shown unless you reconnect it again. I guess the battery problem will be in only my product.Now I replace the product and guess what I get the used product from the seller it was well packed but inside it was a used product . This also have a connection problem when I put it in the pocket and go for a walk it stops and disturb the song this happen for very less time which is too much irritating. Now I am returning it again.
213,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"It's end of November... I fully tested the product and giving an honest review .‚Ä¢ Good sound quality‚Ä¢ Call quality isn't satisfactory as per my need . Does works in quiet areas but not in noisy places my buses , class rooms and had to take them out eventually‚Ä¢ I love listening music in it .‚Ä¢ can't wear it for long hours as it gives me headache (my personal experience might not be applicable to others)‚Ä¢ buds do fit quiet well in my ear and are comfortable.As per for ‚Çπ1100 or more i guess this product gets 3.5/5 out of my 3 months of usage experience"
214,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I am writting this rewiew after 15 days of using this dops.I got this product vary well manner. Perfactly packed. Stereo i checked perfact and bass are exellent.Battery back-up is also vary good. I am using 6-8 hours per day without putting in box. Its work up to 4-5 days with box charge if you have changed fully once.Only thing i am not satisfied with call. In call your caller always compaints of ECHO voice comes whatever you speak. 2ndly you just Can't talk while bike ride. Even i was at 20kmps speed i am not able to talk at all i would say, i have to stop the ride.(You CAN listen music while ride, no issue)Rest of things are exellent."
215,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"This is not a review for the sake of it, I'm writing this after using these for more than 2 weeks. I'll break the review down in points:‚Ä¢ value for money: yes. This is absolute value for money, obviously not the best product but prolly the best product at this price.‚Ä¢sound quality: these are loud enough. Highs don't crack, mids are perfect, lows are clear enough. The bass is not exceptional but it's good enough, you won't be disappointed.‚Ä¢ ergonomics: they're lightweight and that's good. They fit quite well, not perfect but that also depends on your ears, they provide additional moldings of different sizes so fit shall not be a problem for most people.One thing that's appreciable is the touch control, it's just so good to have it because pressing buttons would otherwise have only irritated your ears.‚Ä¢The carry/charging case: It's good enough, I wish it had more resistance in the lid, the lid has become kinda loose with use but it won't accidentally open up either.‚Ä¢Fast charging: that's a big deal, the earbuds get charged real quick."
216,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,1,"Absolute garbage in the name of bluetooth headphones.The audio quality is extremely poor and if you're planning on listening to music, these ones are an absolute junk in terms of sound reproduction. The under 45mhz low bass is virtually absent, low-mids are absolutely flat and lack any punch, the vocals sound muffled, and the highs are a bit too bright for comfort. The small sized driver doesn't help but the tuning on these things are a disaster. If sound quality is what one is looking for, look elsewhere. A 0.5/5 in terms of music listening experience.Coming to calls, while the person on the other end is pretty clearly audible, the microphones on this seem to highlight the background noises much more than the actual speaker's voice leading to a horrible auditory experience to the person at the other end. There have been times when the person on the other end has asked me to get off the bluetooth and use a phone instead as the background noise made it excessively difficult to understand what was being said. A 0/5 when it comes to call handling and noise cancellation capabilities.The headphones have a satisfactory build as does the charger case. The lid could have done with a little better or solid hinge though. The magnets hold the headphones in place well enough. The headphones have a decent finish, don't get warm under excessive usage, and the buds provided are soft enough to fit most ear canals comfortably. A 2.5/5 in terms of the build quality.Overall, these ones have been a major disappointment and I've literally stopped using them already."
217,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"This TWS is good buy if you get at 1000 or under 1000 rs. I bought it 2 months ago at 999 rs and overall i am satisfied with this product, it have good amount of bass as well as treble, point to be noted there is still place for improvement in overall loudness. And biggest plus point of this tws is it's battery, damn its battery last forever. I'm not that much of a hard core user...i use it for 1-2 hr daily and battery last for easily 4-6 days. And yes if you have small ear i could be different to fit in your ear, and painfull over the period of time. If you are looking for casual usage go for it but if you want good sound quality and noise cancellation and all increase you budget and get realme or other one. And its not for fitness and exercises it will fall of while exercising get neckband, at this price range neckband have great audio quality as well as good battery as compare to tws."
218,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,1,"For a reputed company in the buisness of speakers, headphones and sound related products the Airdopes 141 is a huge disaapointment as compared to not only other earbuds of Boat but also as compared to every other truely wireless earbud in the same price range avaialble on Amazon. The product comes in decent packaging in a box small enough to house a pet mollusc or serve as a congested coffin to a dead rodent. The connection quality is only as good as the connection an average lover of these earbuds can make with a woman. The sheer amount of times my music suddenly stopped and the these cheap excuse of a headphones utters its short curse into my ear which represents ""disconnected"". If by an miracle the ear buds manage to stay consistently connected to a mobile for more than 10 minutes they do not work well. It seems the left and right earbud seems to take turns in playing the music. So many times have I found myself willing to smash the charging box because the sound shifts from one earbud to another in fraction of seconds and killing the vibe of music dead. As written in a useless piece of paper called ""manual"" that comes in the box, putting the headphones back in the box closing it and reconnecting after a few seconds is not helpful. The presence of a section based entirely on troubleshooting connection issues speaks a lot about the amount of attention the makers of this abomination gave to actually fixing the problem.Though the headphones deliver decent audio quality while they last but bass remains at an all time low, it is not any use since they do not remain connected. I would absolutely not reccomend any buyer to go for these"
219,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"So I'm here after using it for 1-2 months because i thought writing a review is important, so when i first got the product i was really having bad feelings because of the reviews i saw saying the one side stopped working and unfortunately i also had go through that problem i saw some videos and also tried used them but it started working but then the charging issue happened my mom told me to replace it so i did , i got the replacement the next day and i was still anxious but thank god it worked so inshort for those who just wants to use it for song and videos it's a good product but you might have problem with calling and things the sound quality is okay okay"

I know lots of people has faced connection issues, sometimes one earphone not working, even I also faced the same, but it's not an issue of the earphone, sometimes one of them fails to connect with the bluetooth. In such cases you can put the earbud inside the container and again reconnect. I thought of returning it at first, then I realized. Hope the battery won't deteriorate and sound quality also keeps up. Now coming to microphone, don't expect much from it. If you are in quiet to semi quiet place, you can attend calls, though there will be some lags in the response, still it's manageable. But if you are in bus or any public places, better to not use for phone calls."
223,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I will keep this short and simple. Kindly note that I am reviewing this 48hrs into the purchase...Pros:-----1. Easy connectivity across various devices (yes, it does work with MS Teams!2. Sound is decent considering the price-range. No WOW factor though.3. Lightweight (I used it for 6-7 hrs straight without any ear strain)4. Looks cool! :)5. Fast charging is great!Cons:------1. Battery drains fast. Even with full charge it dint last more than 4-5 hrs of continuous usage.2. Cant not connect/pair with multiple devices at the same time."
224,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I've been using these for about a month now and there are no issues. I use them all day and they keep up with the usage, battery is good. I usually use a single because the noice cancellation is pretty good and I don't hear anything around me. Bass is good too, my main motive was to find a good bass ones so I went with these and I'm glad I chose these. for music listening anytime, they don't fall off from your ears, running, cooking, studying, even sleeping. I can easily sleep with these because they turn off automatically if there is no music playing. Mic quality is quite good too. it's a very good product in this price range of you ask me"
225,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"This is not a review for the sake of it, I'm writing this after using these for more than 2 weeks. I'll break the review down in points:‚Ä¢ value for money: yes. This is absolute value for money, obviously not the best product but prolly the best product at this price.‚Ä¢sound quality: these are loud enough. Highs don't crack, mids are perfect, lows are clear enough. The bass is not exceptional but it's good enough, you won't be disappointed.‚Ä¢ ergonomics: they're lightweight and that's good. They fit quite well, not perfect but that also depends on your ears, they provide additional moldings of different sizes so fit shall not be a problem for most people.One thing that's appreciable is the touch control, it's just so good to have it because pressing buttons would otherwise have only irritated your ears.‚Ä¢The carry/charging case: It's good enough, I wish it had more resistance in the lid, the lid has become kinda loose with use but it won't accidentally open up either.‚Ä¢Fast charging: that's a big deal, the earbuds get charged real quick."

The box was damaged with previously opened remarks and its proof is there in the video uploaded. The delivery people repeatedly argue that you should take the package and do whatever you want later, which is just pathetic.Your delivery guy just said that ""its just 1099 product, whats the big deal. We deliver each day some products of worth 1 lakh. Just take it and go.""Teach them that, its not easy for everyone to buy and use their money.Second, a truthful evaluation of this productSound quality is descent for everyday use but not for music aficionados.Noise cancellation ONLY GOOD FOR HOME NOT FOR CROWDED AREAS.If you are purchasing it for a good base, the bass is actually not the best component.When the volume is kept above 50%, there is a terrible vocal disturbance; below 30%, it is perfectly normal.And its a request to amazon, please give some prior knowledge to your delivery partners that its a customers right to open a package and see if its right to buy or not."
227,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"Battery life on single charge says 6 hours on Amazon and it says 3 hours on Boat Website. This means that when battery life is mentioned, it is probably mentioned for single ear usage which is very unfair. So, for 3 hours that the website says, I get 45 to 75 minutes maximum. If your calls are lasting much longer than this, please look elsewhere. Every meeting I have it is so embarrassing to change the headset in the middle of the meeting saying charge is out. Not recommended for music in any case as the Bass is below average."

231,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,This is the best airpods that I have ever used. Nice battery life in one charge it can last 40 hours easily in low volume and heavy usage then it can last 35-40 hours easily. Good bass but low noise cancellation but it is satisfactory. As a conclusion it is a good product and worthful. You can have it as your need.
232,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"pro -:1.For 1200rs decent looking decent sounding earphone s2. Sound quality is similar as MI basic earphones which is good,base is also decent.3. Decent 3 - 4hrs battery life for earphones and can be charged like 4 or 5 times until battery of case runs out.4. Case only takes around 1 hrs to fully charge.Cons -:1.Not so good connectivity i dont know if its particular problem with my laptop or these earphones cause connectivity is very bad with my laptop (nitro 5).2.If you watch movies or series in very highly compressed or some complex audio format then it might not play audio smoothly (but it only happened once when i was watching a series episode in vlc media player my wired earphones played audio smoothly but these eardopes struggled but it could be the limitation of bluetooth as well).3.Dont buy these for gaming some time lag can be very very noticeable in audio and video and lag can increase if the rendered audio gets very complex like if processor has to process audio of enemy attack + teammate audio + background music + other music in game then lag would increase very much.4.Range is average but it could be particular to your device as well like some phones might have higher bluetooth coverage and some less.Although these are good earphones i would have given them 4.5stars as they are good wireless earphones in budget if you ignore some little cons but boat needs to update their connection sound and welcome music of these earphones.Before buying these i use to think that for comfort these are better than neckbands but actually neckbands are not that bad at all for the following reasons -:1. Neckbands dont have battery in earphones directly beside your ear due to which they are lighter in ear2. Although it may seem convenient to carry airdopes rather than neckband but in some cases not putting your hand in pocket to get the earphones from the box and directly having them hanging in your collar is nice and convenient."
233,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"daily use product and writing this review after 3 days of use. Connectivity occurs instantaneously the issue occurs with continuity of the audio though. There are instances when the connectivity gets lots and a jitter of audio occurs.Audio output quality is comparatively less to the JBL RUN series that i previously used though both have same driver. The body looks very plastic and has a  matte finish which does not provide a premium look compared to the 181 model. Call quality and audio recording quality is pretty good.the bass is good ,still the audio delivery can be better. The battery life is actually pretty amazing, there is no to very minimum lag in audio.And this has zero noise cancellation. you can clearly hear what's happening around and the white noise that is around you, Overall a 3.5/5 would have been better if there was a better audio deliveryEdit : the mic seems to only work for call. Not for recording or video calling via snapcall and other social apps. Hardware Integration seems a Lil off."
234,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I have seen a lot of negative reviews for these earbuds however, these are not bad at all. They are really cheap at 999 INR and the build quality has taken a hit, however, what matters is sound quality which is stellar for this price. I already own a lot of earbuds ranging from 999 to 10k and these for the price are great.The battery life though not as good as claimed however, 5 hours on the earbuds and close to 30-34 hours with the case is much better than the competition.I only have one gripe with these and that has to be the eartips, it's sort of an oval shape and you'll need to find proper seal so try all the different ear tips given in the box."
235,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"well,ihad a confusion whether to choose this or 161 during bbs,because both were the for 899...i checked the reviews and they told this one is better,so i bought it...Positives :- Good sound quality,expected from the price range..- really good battery backup...getting 5hrs for at least and about the case, idk i charge them like in 3 days when it gets to 2 bar charge...so, battery is great ngl nd that was the main reason for choosing this product..- Good fit in the ear, no complaints at all.. however it hurts after like 5hr of usageNegatives :- The first negative is the case itself... it feels so big and cheap... definitely not good looking either... the matte finish doesn't give a premium look also... it's been 3 weeks and i already have permanent scratches on it..- build quality feels cheap, because my one side already started giving buzz sound while calling and listening on higher volume... I'm going to claim warranty for that... it was perfectly ok until last day (almost 3 weeks), and one small fall from hand caused it...- Noise cancellation is not that great on outdoor conditions... you have to talk louder for them to hear you better... but you'll hear them without any issues though... just like every other earpods which doesn't have ANC...concluding, i must say go for other models, because just the battery backup is not going to make it worth of the purchase... it's pretty average...."
236,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"I had to replace it once because the mic in right one was non functional + sometimes it stayed paired even after being put in the case and lid closed.After replacement, I'm writing a review after 10 days use. I would like to mention that earlier I've used bluetooth neckbands- One plus bullet wireless z and Realme wireless 2 Neo.I've used boat wired earphones earlier and I'm not a huge fan of boat. I purchased these Boar Airdrops under influence of Shark Tank üòÇI thought boat may have improved their quality.Now I'm gonna say somethings that's gonna trigger most Indians. Their sense in music sucks. All we Indians care is about bass. That's because it's only bass that a simple fellow can understand from the boom-boom sound and differenciate from a 50‚Çπ roadside earphone. There are other things as vocals, treble including bass etc that's makes a good listening experience.Now since most people only understand bass and demand bass, all the brands have started selling bass edition. And the Indian earphone/headphone market now lacks a good balanced earphone.Now coming to Boat Airdrop after this rant üòÇ I will compare it to my previous bluetooth earphones (one plus bullet wireless z and realme buds 2 Neo)Pros üëçüèª*I got it for ‚Çπ999 so it's the best when price is concerned. Cheapest amongst all my earphones.*It's truly wireless so no wire mess at all.* Pairing is simple and fast.*Very good fit in my ear, lightweight and comfortable(this point differs from person to person and ear shape and size is diffrent)*Battery life is great.*Sound quality is decent compared to the price. Quality of sound has definately improved.*Noise cancelling does work but it's not that great.*Looks good in ears and feels premiumConsüëéüèª*Range is not good. You'll loose connection after 1 wall. My One plus had a range of upto 3 walls. Realme had Range of 2 walls.*This airdrop gets glitchy for a sec or two every now and then but it's not a major problem. Its manageable but annoying at times.*Doesn't pair sometimes. Have to close the lid of the case and reopen it. Sometimes also have to manually connect from phone's Bluetooth option.*The case gets scratches easily. I have the white varient as it looks the best. But for scratches black might be the better option.Conclusion:I would rank one plus bullet wireless z as 1st(not the bass edition) but it's the most expensive also. 2nd position goes to realme buds 2 Neo. Boat airdrop at 3rd position but what more to expect at ‚Çπ999. If price is a constrain go for boat airdrop. Its truly wireless but there's also this headache of not loosing any airdrop by mistake also you'll have to carry the case for safety which is not a case in neckband. So apna apna dekh ke kharid lo üòÇ"
237,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,Amazing and good sound quality. Sadly if you have a slightly old phone you cannot enjoy the effect of these. It gives different sound quality depending on phone. Charges quickly but discharges quickly as well. If you use earphones all the time and hate charging every 6 hrs I recommend boat Rockerz 255 pro + they are amazing.
238,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,I bought it in january 2022 and in august month one side airpod was completely shut because it was not supporting charging.......In the beginning this problem is not that frequent but later it becomes frequent....I claimed my warranty and the brand new product was delivered to me in just 12 days......But guess what! Now this product is facing the same problem in a week ...I will claim the warrenty again...

One thing didn't like about it is the size of the case. It's light but way too big. It creates a mould when kept in pocket.Battery backup of 6 hours per charge is a myth. It can hardly last for 4 to 4.5 hours and not more than that.As my title says, you get what you pay for. It's a decent product for the price one. And better than comfort level of Airdopes 441"

Even though there is passive noise cancellation by virtue of their fit, the Mic(s) are very sensitive to surrounding noise. Don't pick these if you want to use them for calls and you want to use them in a noisy environment.The LED indicators are not flashy - an additional aircraft that I like.Allover a steal deal for the price and the stated purpose.Hope this helps your purchase decision! üëç"

251,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,A very good product by boat indeed and priced very conveniently. You can get it for around 1k online. Considering the money quite good but a few issues here and there.The lack for an app to control the airdopes is evident due to connection issues especially when using just a single airdope. You have to configure everything via your phones bluetooth. But battery and sound quality is quite good. Mic is also average and you can do with it. You can also wear this for working out confidently. Very good product by boat for the price.
252,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"This is my first low budget earbuds. And i must say i am amazed by the quality of this budgeted boat airdopes. The airdopes looks nice asthetically and feels pretty good for the price.. i didn't expect it to have a led light indicator. Felt like an ""icing on the cake"" thing.I have Samsung buds 2 but this one I bought for the rough usage of mine and for travelling purpose as i feel i may lose them. I use it for Hindi and English songs for good trebble usage and med bass.. i have not tried for high bass songs yet.."
253,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,Firstly I gonna say is that the product is on a whole is good but has some drawbacks like the main problem with the left earpiece which after a long use suddenly switches itself off but can be solved by replacing it inthe case and then reconnecting it again with your device. Battery is good but not as good as they are saying but ya technically speaking is pretty long lasting for a day or so noice cancellation is pretty good but again the voice calling is not so well like if you are riding a bike at high speeds and someone calls you up the other person may not be able to hear you properly but in general speaking the product is good for normal usage the case although bulky can easily fit in your pockets some issues are there which I expect the company services gonna look into otherwise the product is worth a try üëçüëç
254,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,This headphones is so good I don't regret buying it first I some before buying they were like one side is not or the battery life is not good but while I bought it was good no issues in it and supposedly you had issue you can get replacement or you have 1 year warranty the sound quality is and the mic quality is like other smart phone and the best thing about us the touch controls it is super useful to pause the song or Play without touching the mobile its worth buying it and thank you
255,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,5,"I had to exchange the product because the first order was delivered with a defective product. The Left pod was not working, which was presumably normal since a lot of the consumers faced it as well. It was correctable, there were lots of videos on YT guiding us on how to connect both sides with 5 taps on both the sensors at the same time. However, no matter how many times and whatever methods I tried my left side simply was not working, no music was being played. I thought perhaps there was something wrong with my device as well or that the pods did not match with my device. Then I realized that the left sensor was working, I could play and pause the music (The right side was playing the music perfectly fine). So, I figure that it was not about connection but that the left side was a defect. The very same day the order was delivered, I placed my grievances and scheduled for a replacement with both the pods working.I got my exchanged product just after 2 days with no issues or hardships.Although, I was disappointed with the first experience the 2nd experience was a saving grace with good services by both parties, i.e the company & delivery agent/agency.Now, about the product in talk.Pros:- Good bass, super long battery life, fast connection, fast charging, I got the cyan+grey combo so the colour is unique & refreshing, it's rather comfortable even after long usage and the sensors are rightly sensitive enough.Cons:- I suppose not the best noise cancellation (3/5) and average call quality. For the extra ears rubbers, I got their single pieces, not in pairs so I'm not quite sure if that's normal or if there has been an error in pairing them. I don't know what to do with single pairs in different sizes, it's rather funny.As someone who barely talks on the phone, I don't really mind the avg. call quality, I can live with it. Same with the noise cancellation(3/4), I don't prioritise that. I want to hear if someone is calling me. I prioritise battery life & bass/sound quality the most and those were delivered so 5 stars it is.I suppose the review is subjected to what one prioritises the most.For the price, the quality is on par with it. If you want super-duper quality in all the fields then I'd suggest you be ready to pay higher instead of paying a lower price and being so disappointed with it."
256,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"After using 6 months it's really stunning, but only one problem is noise cancellation issues.From strating to till now noise cancellation issues is coming while making calls."
257,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I am a big fan of Boat, i have used many of their wired and wireless devices for last 8 years and they are still my go to brand for earphones.This is my first ever earpodes and i love it.1. Audio is good as always but i have better experience from my Boat Roackers 261 wireless which still works fine other than small break on the wire after rough usage during gym, workout, long distance train and public transport for almost 3 years.2. No physical buttons , feather touch and hold for pause/ play/ next/previous/ voice assistant.Here i fee like the sensitivity is too high, i am more used to hard clicky buttons.3. Case is sturdy , i like that it closes itself when  tilted or hold upside down. Good job there by the designers.4. Super fast charging is real and they should mention the super fast pairing too haha5. can used mono also , that is any one of the earpodes can be turned off while other one can still stay on.i haven't used enough to comment on battery backup and noise cancellation but from my experience with Boat for many years,  iam sure they will perform good and  I am looking forward to it.just from first experience , its a awesome product.Boat understands our Indian market than anyone else. Its a best buy for the value.GO FOR IT#IAmAboAthead*update after 6 months usage1. everything works fine now2. at some time like for 1 or 2 months, ear buds was not charging properly. had to fit and adjust the buds by hand in the case which was very annoying. but its okay now after giving some beating.3.no other sound or connectivity issues."

262,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"Updating my 1 star review after I somewhat figured out how to make it work with my Macbook. Still a 3 star product - it needs to work out of the box.I read a few reviews which mentioned that this keeps disconnecting with the new M1 macs, but I decided to experiment anyway as I got them for a good price during the sale (~900). I received them and they worked great with iPhone, OnePlus, iPad, Windows laptop - but alas, not with my M1 Macbook Air. I have been using a Boat Rockerz 550 for a few months and that has always worked like a charm. These airdopes do not disconnect, but the sound keeps breaking every few seconds. So I decided to replace them, but the same problem persisted with the new ones as well.I searched around a bit for generic posts on bluetooth earphone connectivity problems for M1 macs and came across a few solutions - many of which did not work. After a week of tinkering around, I finally have an answer. THE WIFI MODULE OF M1 MAC INTERFERES WITH AIRDOPES 141.1. They always work when wifi is off.2. They sometimes work when wifi is connected to 2.4g.3. They sometimes work when wifi is connected to 5g.2 and 3 are mutually exclusive - if you are facing issues, change to a different frequency.Otherwise, these are good for the price and you get what you pay for. You can't expect airpods like quality for this price."

The charging case top just wiggle a little bit."
266,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,5,"The boat airdopes 141 are really superb. Putting it in the ear, I could feel the bass of the songs while all sorts of environmental noise was almost inaudible. It really gave me goosebumps. It's quite comfortable to put it in for a long time and you won't feel any sort of inconvenience. The most amazing thing is the battery backup. It's literally a lot more than enough. I use it for less than an hour a day, it's been about a week since, and still it has got more than 75% charge. So even if multiple people use it, still it won't pose any problem. Really loved the product. Thanks Amazon and Thanks Boat."
267,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†This product is very good. The sound quality is very clear and awesome. Just that it doesn't have that good bass. Noise cancellation is good but could be better. I tried to play games with it, I played Minecraft and GTA 5, the sound was awesome. I would recommend this to everyone whose budget is under 1500. I just regret that I didn't choose the white color but this color is also good. Built quality is very good and it comes with a matt finish. The magnets in the hinges are superb. There is an advantage that you can use only one bud at a time if you want. The mic is okay but could be better. This is a very good TWS released by Boat. I thank boat for this awesome product.I hope my review helps you with your decision..."
268,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,Music is ok nice and bass is normal...but call quality is little bad....can't hear my voice in opposite side
269,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,5,"I've checked both 141 and 141 Pro.I've seen the main difference in sound quality is the base and clearness.I give priority to sound quality everytime.And I've seen 141 is more better than 141 pro.And also in comfort 141 is better will not fall. 141 pro falls and not get fit in ears.First time i wore. And hear the turning on sound and connecting sound i thought it's trash. Not a good earphones. But after i play a song, then i realised. It's same as my boat wired earphones. Best sound quality.But just a bit less bass. I love it."
270,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,charging cable is missing
271,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"Because it's cheap, so can't really compare it on the higher end in terms of sound quality, connectivity and comfort.Everything is okay okay.Only problem is comfort.Ear pains a lot, really not comfortable to use.I only bought it to use for Audible ebook reader, podcast, Kuku FM.Well, I should have bought a higher end air buds.Ab itna rupiya main itna hish milega situation.General summary: okay, not that great for the price range."
272,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"Hello buyers,This is a request if you're purchasing this to use for calling purpose then i must say this is not the one to go for.. initially i thought may be a little bit of cancelation atleast it may have but its not actually. Even its very usefull if you wanted to use to gather any other noise surrounded by ur self.. i mean it catches all the other sounds like bus other persons who spokes to someone else just beside you, instead of your voice.The buds are like..once you insert into you ears it will stop all other outside sounds.. i mean if you won't play any song and you try to say something louder you may feel terrible.. it feels the same effect like you have closed your ears by some blocker.. you can't use this while riding bikes because of this reason.If you're at home and alone then its very good to use.. the sound quality is very nice this is the only best point of this..Battery life is very good. Quick change.For normal movies or songs at 100% volume its goes for 3 hr and Calling 1 hr.Look wise good..one thing the touch is not always responsive.This review is after one month use of this device."

It's been 1 month of this product since I have purchased it. Trust me it is totally worth it if you are planning to buy a best sound quality Bluetooth. It's sound is premium. Looks are amazing. Battery life is just wow ! I am giving it 4 star just because of its exterior built quality, it is not so good and you will find many scratches after purchasing it. Thanks ."
274,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,1,I bought this thing recently few months ago and in the beginning it worked..the Audio quality bass quality etc isn‚Äôt that great however it‚Äôs a cheap product we can‚Äôt expect anything great in this however after few months of usage it stopped working i don‚Äôt know how but it literally stopped working..the earbuds is not getting charged in that case‚Ä¶and even after keeping it in the case for many hours it doesn‚Äôt blink and it‚Äôs not even getting connected to my phone‚Ä¶whenever it gets connected it shows battery at 10 percent‚Ä¶I just regret buying this cheap quality product‚Ä¶boat sucks‚Ä¶üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
275,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"you really cant expect more from earbuds at this price range, but it  does the job well, minor technical problems for which u have to adjust and has gone through serious compramisation in sound quality and bass qualityThe battery life is good, holds good for the price range that it is available in.Spends about 10% battery for 30 mins of uninterrupted use.worth considering for this price, but if u have a slightly more budget then i'd say to go for something with a better sound quality than this"
276,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,5,"Updating after using it for 5 daysI purchased the buds for 999 during the republic day sale, it's worth the price, as promised the battery backup is pretty good, I use the buds for 3 hours every day, and it lasts for 4 days easily on a single charge. When I received the buds it was charged completely and it lasted for 4 days.Pros:-Sound clarity is pretty decent for the priceBattery backupPretty cool lookingAuto pairs on as soon as you remove it from the caseCons -Touch is very sensitive, but it again depends on how you use itNoise Cancellation was promoted, but I could still hear the outside noise.Overall for the price it's totally worth it and that's why I've given it a 5 star rating!"
277,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,I'am using this product for past 3 months its very easy to pair with device we just open case also it will be paired automatically.noise cancellation is not that much efficient we can use phone calls in silent place we cannot use this with outdoor for calling. coming to audio quality its not that much gud in quality comparing to other brands over all this product quite ok for normal use.
278,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,Just  a okay product having a lot of unusual and unclear Bass. Don't know why and how people think this is a great product. Is it only fpr value for money or they really loved the sound quality. Anyway if they loved the sound quality then the ratings gave by them is okay.  But if they gave ratings just for value for money then first they should know why and how people rate rhe product.Anyway... Just a budget friendly Okay Product.

I tried it many time and same issue happen.Good design though. Boat should add one more features to connect more than one device, it only connect one device at a time. Overall this is good in term of battery backup, sound quality, touch response, build quality. At last it's a Good product.you can recommend it"
285,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"The Product is good. Quality of sound is also very good. However once connected with Amazon Fire stick, we cannot control the volume. It plays at full volume and it is inconvenient. Since these pods do not have volume control option, volume can be controlled only through the media device it is connected to. I cannot do it when it is connected to Amazon Fire Stick. Any help will be appreciated."
286,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I liked the product very much . I am fully satisfied with this airdopes as it have a good base , noise cancelation,  easy fit and most important have a very long lasting battery life ."
287,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"TLDR; Good sound quality, but wont survive drops.I own a pair of Oppo Enco Buds for a year and they haven't disappointed me. I've dropped it plenty times on accident, still the quality is good. Now when it comes to the Boat Airdopes 141, the sound quality is at par with the Oppo one, no complaints. But a few days back I dropped but my Boat Airdopes 141 and to my horror it almost ended up broken. ALMOST. It was once. The sound quality hasn't been compromised, yet. I'm in no place to give a return request and wait for it to be exchanged as I need it urgently. Overall, the physical structure could be improved. JUST PLEASE DON'T DROP IT. And the charge lasts long. Comfortable in the ear but I feel like it might drop off sometimes."

291,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,3,"I guess I should have read a bit more before buying this product. Make no mistake, the airdopes were absolutely smooth with the connection, battery backup and very pleasant incoming sound hearing experience. However, I couldn't speak on an office call even in a moderate to mild background noise. Works only if there is dead background silence. Will probably use this for hearing purposes only, as there is only a replace accepted for the product, and no return."
292,boAt Airdopes 141 True Wireless,4,"I have used it for a week and didn't got any trouble while using it voice cancellation is pretty much good , but in the other hand beast mode gives  the lover latency while playing bgmi or free fire , playback time also as same as they say in short this thing worth buying !!"

300,Smart Watch Id-116 Bluetooth Smartwatch,1,"I ordered couple of watches for my kids and got them delivered today. Following are my findings:1. Build quality is bad - the plastic is cheap and the band is not at all good.2. It does not have a touchscreen - it has a sensor/button at the center-bottom which will take your commands. The rest of the screen is insensitive to touches. This watch DOES NOT have full touchscreen capability as opposed to what the seller/company is claiming.3. Watch Dial/screen is small - the actual size of the display is much smaller than what is advertised.4. Bezel is thick - the bezel is quite thick and does not look good.5. Connectivity Issue - this is the biggest issue. I downloaded VeryFitPro app on two different Android devices and then tried connecting the watches to them, however, the watches did not connect no matter how many times I tried.Verdict - the watches are wastage of money and time. I am dropping a request for their return/refund."

402,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Awesome shoes with light weight and great grip.
403,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Awesome
404,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,"It's a perfect fit for 10.I'm a regular customer in amazon, not disappointments till date.The first thing is it's ORIGINAL, proper Puma shoes.The shoes look lit, and are very comfortable.And I'm pretty sure it's going to go on for a long time, yet to use it.Thank you amazon!!"
405,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Nicely packedComfortableSoft soleColor is almost similar to the template in AmazonThe only issue is its back area are padded and a bit harder then rest of the shoe sometimes it get uncomfortable if you are wearing it for longer periods.
406,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Some what it is bad bcoz elastic is not given in side part therefore u may feel some what difficulty to wear
407,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,Awesome Shoes from PUMA very much light weight... literally very light weight can't believe....and fits well provided correct shoes size..I bought it for jogging purpose will have to wait for the life of these shoes if anything changes happen will post update here... overall great product for the price...Thank you #AMAZONThank you #PUMA
408,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†This is more of a slip on shoe as opposed to a lased shoe as shown. Having said that, I advise those interested to order as per your exact foot size.Compared to my previous reebok or Fila shoes the soft gell Insoles definitely make this shoe a lot more comfortable. The shoe is light. Ideal for regular joggers."
409,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Shoe is good and nice quality but wearing them on foot is big task it took around 10 minutes to wear after wearing size is perfect but wearing them is difficult
410,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,"It's damn comfortable , value for money üíØ"
411,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Awesome shoesSo much pretty and awesomeI'm said' thanks to Amazon for Puma emergence black running shoes
412,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,The sole is just amazing. Feels like u are walking with a sponge on your shoe sole
413,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Very soft and light weight
414,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,-
415,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,The sole of the shoe could be more comfortable
416,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,3,The shoe is good and its incredibly comfort but the design of the shoe is too narrow its hard to wear and remove..you really need to pull so hard to wear this shoe ...so i returned it..but the quality and comfort was awesome
417,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,"Go for the black shoesVery comfort in wearing, light in weight and great looking shoesThere is bit difficult in placing your legs inside this , and due to this choose your size carefully. Choose the size just above your normal size."
418,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,Quality awesome
419,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,The best part of this is the sole of this shoe .. its colours are quite attractive and are comfortable too it has a different design for which youbmay have problem in wearing it but once you wear they are very soft and light weight
420,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,The model was soo classy I gifted it to my father but the opening is small for wide foot so I returned it
421,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,"Shoes are very comfortable and value for money..I honestly suggest if you want shoes for sports , running,  gym and other physical activities.."
422,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,Shoes are nice just d size doest not fit right

426,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,2,I already own a size 9 puma running shoe but similar size in this style is somewhat large.I think if you can address the size variation across different styles it would be very helpful.If you have a provision for atleast mentioning the actual dimensions that would be enough.
427,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Very good product and quality provided by puma.
428,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,"Awam product by Amazon, Thanks a lot.....awsm"

430,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,4,Take a correct size or else the product is worth money
431,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,5,Only problem is when you will wear you have to put so more effort as reguler. But once you wear it's very lightweight and comfortable. Shole and cousin is very good I am going to gym and it's very comfortable while doing exercise. Its looks cool with your reguler outfits. I like the product
432,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,3,Design is a bit bulge from the sides and colour is also not as expected.
433,Puma Mens Emergence Running Shoe,1,"Putting them on is in itself an adventure. You have to sit down for a good 5-10 minutes and push your feet inside while grunting like you're engaged in some adventure sport. If you succeed, Hurray! They're very comfortable. If you dont, consider sawing your feet from sides and heels to match the shoes design..."
